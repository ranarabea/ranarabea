# Hi, I'm Rana Rabee

I'm a Robotics Engineering student with a strong interest in  
low-level systems, operating systems, and CPU architecture.

I focus on building educational, system-level projects using  
C, Python, Assembly, and Linux to deeply understand how computers work under the hood.

##  About Me
-  Studying Computer Engineering
-  Interested in Operating Systems, CPU pipelines, computer architecture
-  I prefer learning by building simulators and tools, not just theory
-  Currently learning: Linux systems programming & low-level architecture

---

##  Technical Skills
- Programming Languages: C, Python, Assembly (8086), HTML/CSS  
- Systems & Tools: Linux, Bash, Git, GCC, Make  
- Core Concepts:  
  - CPU pipelining & hazards  
  - Cache coherence & memory hierarchy  
  - OS scheduling & process management  
  - Low-level arithmetic & instruction execution

## 🎓 Academic & Practical Work
Through my coursework and self-driven learning, I’ve worked on projects that translate theoretical concepts into practical implementations:

- Computer Architecture Projects  
  Implementing CPU pipeline simulations, hazard handling, branch behavior, and cache coherence concepts.

- Operating Systems Labs  
  Hands-on experience with Linux processes, scheduling, synchronization, and inter-process communication.

- Assembly & Low-Level Programming  
  Developing 8086 Assembly programs focusing on arithmetic operations, flags behavior, and instruction-level execution.

- Python for Systems & Analysis  
  Using Python to support simulations, visualize results, and analyze system behavior.

These projects are designed to strengthen my understanding of how hardware and software interact, rather than just producing surface-level applications.
