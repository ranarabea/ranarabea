# Hi, I'm Rana Rabee
I am a Computer Engineering (Robotics) student with a strong focus on computer systems, operating systems, computer architecture, and low-level programming, combined with exposure to AI, virtual reality, and embedded systems.

Throughout my studies, I developed a solid understanding of computing from both the hardware and software perspectives, starting from mathematical and logical foundations, moving through core computer science concepts, and advancing into system-level and real-time applications.

## 🔹 Projects & Hands-On Work
Across my coursework, I completed practical projects and labs for nearly every core subject, translating theoretical concepts into working implementations.

These projects included:
- Implementing algorithms and data structures with attention to correctness and efficiency  
- OS-related labs involving processes, scheduling, synchronization, and real-time constraints  
- Computer architecture and microprocessor projects focused on instruction execution, CPU behavior, and memory organization  
- Embedded and real-time system projects emphasizing timing, control logic, and hardware–software interaction  
- AI and VR-related projects, including a 3D game developed using Unity and C#, focusing on real-time behavior and performance considerations  

My projects prioritize deep system-level understanding over surface-level application development.

What differentiates my learning approach is a strong focus on understanding how systems actually work internally, not just how to use them. I am particularly interested in the interaction between hardware and operating systems, low-level execution, and performance behavior.
